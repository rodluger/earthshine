## emi_S<X>_<YY>_d-54.dat
From Roland Vanderspek. Earth/Moon interference table for Sector <X>.  Gives angular and physical distance of Earth and Moon from the boresights of the four cameras as a function of five different time standards.  Likely best used to estimate brightness of blob.

## emangles_S<X>_<YY>_d-54.dat
From Roland Vanderspek. Earth/Moon interference table for Sector <X>.  Gives  elevation above sunshade, azimuth around S/C axis, and distance for Earth and Moon as a function of five different time standards. Likely best to localize the blob in FOV.
